Description: The compound growth rate indicates the percentage change of a specific variable over a defined period. It is calculated using non-linear models, particularly the exponential model. To estimate the compound growth rates, the growth model is first converted to semilog form and then analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. This package has been developed using concept of Shankar et al. (2022)<doi:10.3389/fsufs.2023.1208898>.
